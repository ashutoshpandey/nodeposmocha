Used generator-express to create project

Added knex dependency

Created knexfile.js on root and added development/test database settings

Ran following commands for creating migrations

knex migrate:make article

Added db/knex.js for knex database settings
Added util/encryption.js for encrypting user secret keys

Created controllers:
    article.js          To handle api requests for article

    /api/articles       GET     -                   Reads all articles
    /api/articles/id    GET     id                  Read a particular article
    /api/articles/id    DELETE  id                  Delete a particular article
    /api/articles       POST    title,url,text      Create a new article
    /api/articles/id    PUT     title,url,text      Update an existing article

    user.js             To handle user create/login requests

    /users              POST    name,username,password      Create a new user
    /authenticate       POST    username,password           User login, returns json web token

    static.js           To handle static pages like index, about-us, contact-us etc.


Steps:
    1. Create a new user, a uuid secret key will be stored against user record

    2. User login
        2.a. Token generated using user secret key
        2.b. Secret key encrypted and stored in session

    3. Call any /api/** url
        3.a. Middleware receives token in URL or request body
        3.b. Middleware reads encrypted user secret from session
        3.c. Encrypted secret key is then decrypted
        3.d. Middleware verifies the token with the help of decrypted user secret

    4. If token is verified, the requested resource is processed
